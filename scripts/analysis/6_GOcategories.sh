# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #


# For the species included in the analysis (for which we computed relatedness in previous step)
# We now measure cooperativity split in 5 GO categories
# That's 101 species, listed in ./data/species_info_files/species_list.txt
# We work with the representative genome of those species, as listed in MIDASdb
# We use downloaded genome features that are downloaded at previous step (script 5_secretome.sh)

# STEPS ARE:
# 1)
